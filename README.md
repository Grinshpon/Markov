# Markov

A Haskell Powered Calculator

Markov is currently a work in progress calculator program. It currently has no practical functionality because it is incomplete, but eventually it will be able to perform calculations with algebraic expressions, vectors and matrices, derivatives and integrals. It will be able to store variables and functions.
At some point, Markov may also serve as the back-end for an eventual visual calculator application.

### Example:

    >> 5 * (2+1)
      15
    >> x = 7
      7
    >> x/2
      4.5
